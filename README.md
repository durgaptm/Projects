## ML Engineer Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of Projects related to Machine Learning completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes, presented in forms of Jupyter notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under Dataset directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

### Instructions for Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally
-Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

### Contents

- **Machine Learning**
    - Banglore Real Estate Price Prediction : A model to predict the value of a given house in the Banglore real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
    - Wine Quality Detection : The project aims to predict the quality of red wine and analyze the chemical properties that influence the standard of wine. 

- **Natural Language Processing**
    - Sentiment Analysis of P2P Platforms : 2-way polarity (positive and negative) classification system for P2P Platforms, using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
    - Text Classification : A multilabel classification model to predict the category of different news articles such as Political, Religious etc.
    - Auto-Correct Feature : A similar feature to that of the smartphone we are using now, but this would be an implementation of Natural Language Processing on a smaller dataset like a book.

- **Deep Learning**
    - Potato Disease Detection : A simple Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.
    - Age & Gender Detection : A Deep Learning Training Model that will detect age and gender of a person in an image.
    
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market :  Exploratory Data Analysis of the Airbnb market in New york. The data is ingested and combined from multiple file types, and cleaned to extract accurate information.
    - Word Frequency in Classic Novels :  Web Scraping and Exploratory Analysis of the html form of classic novel - 'The Three Musketeers' from Project Gutenberg website. Uses NLP to find the most frequent words in the novel.
    - Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market : Exploratory Data Analysis on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency data of the year 2017. The data is cleaned and then visualized to get insights on the cryptocurrency market.

- **SQL Projects**
    - Analyzing the World Population : In this project, the dataset by CIA World Factbook was used to explore how the world population spreads across different countries.
