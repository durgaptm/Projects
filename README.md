## ML Engineer Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of Projects related to Machine Learning completed by me for academic and self-learning purposes, presented in forms of Jupyter notebooks.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under Dataset directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*

###Instructions for Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally
-Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

###Contents

- Machine Learning
    - Banglore Real Estate Price Prediction : A model to predict the value of a given house in the Banglore real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
    - Wine Quality Detection : The project aims to predict the quality of red wine and analyze the chemical properties that influence the standard of wine. 

- Natural Language Processing
    - Sentiment Analysis of P2P Platforms : 2-way polarity (positive and negative) classification system for P2P Platforms, using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
    - Text Classification : A multilabel classification model to predict the category of different news articles such as Political, Religious etc.

- Deep Learning
    - Potato Disease Detection : A simple Image Classification Model that will categorize Potato Leaf Disease using a simple and classic Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.

- SQL Projects
    - Analyzing the World Population : In this project, the dataset by CIA World Factbook was used to explore how the world population spreads across different countries.
